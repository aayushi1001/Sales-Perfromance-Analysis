Problem Solving Approach :

The Saved Sample â€“ Superstore dataset is used. 

A bullet chart with Category and Segment dimensions and Sales measures is created. 

The data is then blended with the Saved Sample - Sales Target data set to bring in the Sales Target measure. 

The charts are color coded to identify Categories and Segments that are above or below target. 

The year of sales is added to the view to identify trends and outliers. 

A filter is added so that the user can select one, more than one, or all years. 

A dashboard is created with this view.
